### Project: Ultimate Divoc Tracker
**Ultimate DivocTracker _(UDT)_** is a desktop app for managing COVID-19 contacts in school administration, optimized for use via interacting with the application through easy-to-use commands on a user-centric interface.
Ultimate Divoc Tracker can get your contact-tracing tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

School administrators _(like teachers)_ in charge of managing COVID-19 can use UDT to easily track COVID-19 cases amongst the student population with ease and concentrate on what matters most, the education of the students.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
