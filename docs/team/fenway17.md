### Project: Ultimate Divoc Tracker

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative. This application is a variation of the above original project, tailored for school administrators to track COVID-19 cases amongst students in schools.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Status attribute for persons (Pull request [\#32](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/32))
  * What it does: Gives each person in the list a status attribute denoting their COVID-19 status.
  * Justification: Track COVID-19 status of each person
  * Highlights: Status can be `"Positive"`, `"Negative"` or `"Close-Contact"`
  * Credits: *{Collaborators: Yong Rui, Zi Foong}*

* **New Feature**: Command to find persons by Class Code (Pull request [\#56](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/56))

  * Highlights: Given Class Code can be part of the full Class Code
  * Credits: *{}*

* **New Feature**: Command to find persons by Activity (Pull request [\#83](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/83))
