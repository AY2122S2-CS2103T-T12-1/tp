### Project: Ultimate Divoc Tracker
Ultimate Divoc Tracker is a desktop app for managing COVID-19 contacts in school admin, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Ultimate DivocTracker can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
