### Project: Tracey

Tracey is a desktop app for NUS admin staffs to track the covid health status of the students and manage the covid situation on campus, optimized for use via a CLI while still having the benefits of a GUI. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
Tracey aims to ease the barrier to manage the covid outbreak on campus and provide data for possible studies purposes.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Add entry**: Added the ability to find an entry.
    * What it does: allows the user to find the details of a student of interest.
    * Justification: This feature is fundamental to the product because a user can check the particular health status of students.
    * Highlights: This enhancement increases the ease of locating and checking on the well being of the student. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Add a delete command that allows the user to remove students from the list if the student is no longer a student of the school.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
        * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
