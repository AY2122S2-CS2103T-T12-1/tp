### Project: Ultimate Divoc Tracker

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative. This application is a variation of the above original project, tailored for school administrators to track COVID-19 cases amongst students in schools.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
