### Project: Ultimate Divoc Tracker

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative. 

This application is a variation of the above original project, tailored for school administrators to automate the tracking COVID-19 cases amongst students in schools.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Batch Update Status based on Class Code -- (Pull request:[\#70](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/70))
  * What it does:
    * Upon a positive case in the ClassCode, all student's status in that ClassCode will be updated to Close-Contact
    * If no positive cases in the ClassCode, all student's status in that ClassCode wil be updated back to Negative
  * Justification: Track and automate COVID-19 close contact using class code
  * Credits: *{Collaborators: Jun Hong, Joshua, Louis}*
