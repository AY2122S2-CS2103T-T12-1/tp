//              After updating a student's information, now I need to check all of his/her classmates.
//              In doing so, need to retrieve a list of students who matches the same classcode.

//              Proposed Steps:
//              1. Add new method -> isStatusFieldEdited (Adapted from isAnyFieldEdited -> check toCopy.status)
//              2. if toCopy.status is not null/empty && is "Positive", iterate through lastShownList for each
//              student that exist in the same class as the COVID-19 Positive student
//              3. for (Person student : lastShownList):
//              if toCopy.name != currentStudent && student.getClassCode == currentStudent.getClassCode:
//              edit the student's status to Close Contact
//              end
